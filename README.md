## Setting up DevSpace

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js

Before you can start working on DevSPace, you need to have Node.js
installed on your machine. The currently supported versions are `10.15.0` or greater.

To download Node.js visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

_NOTE: You can use a tool like [`NVM`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
or [`N`](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and manage multiple node versions_

#### Yarn

In addition to Node.js we use `yarn` to facilitate multi package development.

To install `yarn` follow the instructions listed on their website:
https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
#### Verify Prerequisites

You can verify your setup by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ node -v
$ yarn -v
```
Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can build by
running the following command at the root of DevSpace:

```bash
$ yarn build
```
## Running devSpace on your local server
